# ☁️ Cloud Billing Dashboard

A lightweight **web dashboard** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that visualizes **AWS** and **Azure billing data** via APIs.  
This project is ideal for learning **API integration**, **cloud cost visualization**, and **data-driven frontend development**.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-billing-dashboard.git
   cd cloud-billing-dashboard
Open the project
Just open index.html in your web browser.

(Optional) Host it online

Deploy easily on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

🌩️ Integrating Real Cloud Billing APIs
🟦 For Azure
Use the Azure Consumption API:

js
Copy code
// Example endpoint (replace with your token and subscription)
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/usageDetails?api-version=2023-05-01
Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>
You can generate access tokens using Azure AD OAuth 2.0.

🟧 For AWS
Use the AWS Cost Explorer API:

js
Copy code
import { CostExplorerClient, GetCostAndUsageCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cost-explorer";

const client = new CostExplorerClient({ region: "us-east-1" });
const data = await client.send(
  new GetCostAndUsageCommand({
    TimePeriod: { Start: "2025-10-01", End: "2025-10-31" },
    Granularity: "DAILY",
    Metrics: ["BlendedCost"],
  })
);
⚠️ To use AWS SDK securely in a web app, route requests through a backend (to avoid exposing credentials).

🧠 How It Works
Select a cloud provider (AWS or Azure)

Click Fetch Billing Data

The app either:

Fetches mock data (for demo use), or

Retrieves real data using APIs (if configured)

The data is visualized in an interactive bar chart

🧩 Future Enhancements
📆 Add date range and filtering options

📈 Include trend line charts for cost over time

🔐 Secure API token management via backend

🧮 Support for GCP billing datasets

💬 Add cost anomaly detection alerts

💡 Tip: You can use this as a base for a full-stack cloud cost analytics app by adding an Express.js or Flask backend to securely fetch live billing data.

Would you like me to also include a **preview image** and **badges** (like “Built with Chart.js”, “Deployed on Vercel”) in the README for extra polish before you upload it to GitHub?
